# Puppy-Picker
This website assists the user in picking their ideal puppy, learn more about puppies that match with the user, and find nearby shelters. 

It is part of our Spring 2019 Capstone project so it is a work in progress.

The website is currently hosted by Rowan here: http://elvis.rowan.edu/~mayorgag4/capstone/puppypicker.php

It is an ongoing project, so not all features are currently displayed. 

By the end of the Spring 2019 Semester, the project will be complete.
